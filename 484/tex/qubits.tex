\section{Measurment}

Albert Einstein once said:
\begin{quote}
I think that matter must have a 
separate reality indepenent of the measurements. 
That is an electron has spin, location and so forth even when 
it is not being measured, I like to think that the moon is there even if 
I am not looking at it.
\end{quote}

A quantum state is in a \textit{superposition state} when 
one is not looking at it. And when we look at the state 
or \textit{measure} does a different system form with 
physical quantities of interest.
