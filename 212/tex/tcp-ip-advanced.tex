\textit{Summary}

NAT violates the IP model, which states that every IP address uniquely 
identifies a single machine worldwide. 

NAT changes the internet from connectionless to connection-oritened 
because end-to-end connections depend on the state of NAT gateways. 

NAT violates protocol layering. The network layer makes 
assumptions about the transport layer by knowing about port 
numbers and remapping them for outgoing connections. 

NAT retricts the transport layer to TCP and UDP. 
Other transport layers like RTP are not necessarily supported. 

NAT fails with protocols that include internal IP addresses in the payload

NAT only supports $< 65536$ machines living behind a NAT router with a 
single externally visible IP address.
