\section{Observer Pattern}

Used when objects need to be notified of changes in
another object. The object that is listening implements an
interface containing a callback function that is invoked when
a change occurs.

\section{Iterator Pattern}

Provides a method to traverse an aggregate data
structure while abstracting away assumptions about that
data structure.

\section{Visitor Pattern}

Used to perform operations specific to the dynamic type of
nodes in a data structure without having to change the
definition of the nodes.

\section{State Pattern}
