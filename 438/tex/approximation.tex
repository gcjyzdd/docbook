\section{Introducing Approximation}



\section{Vertex Cover}

The approximation algorithm is very simple. 
We start with an empty set and continue to add 
vertices until we set is a vertex cover. 

%c := \{ \}
%E` := E[G]
%while E` is not empty do
%Let (u, v) be an arbitrary edge of E`
%    c := c \cup {u, v}
%    Remove from E` every edge incident on either u or v
%return c
